# opendata.education
This repository provides an issue tracker for logging issues, suggestions, and general discussion around the data published by opendata.education

## What data sets are used by opendata.education?
All data sets used are documented at https://opendata.education/status, with a machine readable list available at https://opendata.education/status.json.

We are always looking to for new data sources. If you know of one that would be useful and improve the opendata.education service then please add an issue to this repository's tracker.

## What format is the data presented in?
Currently the data is presented using the [SIF UK 2.0 data model](http://specification.sifassociation.org/Implementation/UK/2.0/html/), an open and popular standard for education information interchange.

In producing this service we have begun building a use case to extend the SIF UK 2.0 data model to include representing multi-academy trust and school sponsor information. At the moment this is presented as part of the API under SIF UK 2.x, and will be subject to change.

Future data models being considered are:
- [SIF NA 3.3](http://specification.sifassociation.org/Implementation/NA/3.3/contents.xhtml)
- [SIF AU 3.4](http://specification.sifassociation.org/Implementation/AU/3.4/)
- [ISB](https://data.gov.uk/education-standards/)
